Supported Node.js versions
Supported Node.js versions
Last updated September 15, 2025
Default and available versions
By default, a new project uses the latest Node.js LTS version available on Vercel.

Current available versions are:

24.x (default)
22.x
20.x
Only major versions are available. Vercel automatically rolls out minor and patch updates when needed, such as to fix a security issue.

Setting the Node.js version in project settings
To override the default version and set a different Node.js version for new deployments:

From your dashboard, select your project.
Select the Settings tab.
On the Build and Deployment page, navigate to the Node.js Version section.
Select the version you want to use from the dropdown. This Node.js version will be used for new deployments.
Select your Node.js version in Project Settings.
Select your Node.js version in Project Settings.
Version overrides in package.json
You can define the major Node.js version in the engines#node section of the package.json to override the one you have selected in the Project Settings:

package.json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "24.x"
  }
}
For instance, when you set the Node.js version to 20.x in the Project Settings and you specify a valid semver range for Node.js 24 (e.g. 24.x) in package.json, your project will be deployed with the latest 24.x version of Node.js.

The following table lists some example version ranges and the available Node.js version they map to:

Version in package.json	Version deployed
24.x
^24.0.0
>=20.0.0	latest 24.x version
22.x
^22.0.0	latest 22.x version
20.x
^20.0.0	latest 20.x version
Checking your deployment's Node.js version
To verify the Node.js version your Deployment is using, either run node -v in the Build Command or log process.version.
